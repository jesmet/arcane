#Write a Python program to check if a driver is overspeeding.

#The program should 

#1. Prompt the user to enter the speed of the car (in km/h)
#2. If the speed is greater than 60, display the message: "You are overspeeding! Slow down!"
#3. If the speed is 60 or less, display nothing





#hashim

S=int(input("Enter the speed of the vehicle"))
if S>60:
   print("you are overspeeding !slow down!")


#farsana
speed=int(input("enter the speed of the car (in km/h)"))
if speed >=60:
    print("you are overspeeding! slow down!")

#faris
speed = int(input("enter the speed ")
if speed > 60:
   print("you are overspeeding ! slow down!")
