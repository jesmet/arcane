#Day 4 
##while loop
#Write a Python program to simulate a "Number Guessing Game".

#1. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).


#2. The user has to guess the number.


#3. After each guess, the program will give feedback:

#If the guess is too high, the program should print "Too high! Try again."

#If the guess is too low, the program should print "Too low! Try again."

#If the guess is correct, the program should print "Correct! You guessed the number."
